<h1>Court of the Seven Headed Serpent Beginner's Guide</h1>
<p>A crash course in Court's calculating and controlling playstyle.</p>
<p>The Court of the Seven Headed Serpent (&quot;Court&quot;) is the weirdest faction in Trench Crusade. Other factions are playing XCOM, while you are playing a puzzle game. You will often deprioritize scenario objectives in favor of keeping your Elites on the board and taking enemy models Out of Action.</p>
<p>This guide assumes you've read the rulebook and <em>Warbands of Trench Crusade</em>, and understand the game's rules. It is not a full campaign guide or comprehensive strategy guide, just a quick primer with a few common builds and strategies.</p>
<h2>Core Mechanics</h2>
<p>Court models have <em>Goetic Powers</em>, which cost Blood Markers to use. You can use Blood Markers from <em>any</em> model on the entire board that does not have the DEMONIC or BLACK GRAIL keywords. This includes friendly Wretches, most enemy models, and in some scenarios non-player models.</p>
<p>You need a steady supply of Blood Markers to fuel your Goetic Powers. There are three basic strategies:</p>
<h3>Blood Batteries</h3>
<p>Blood Batteries generate Blood Markers by having Yoke Fiends directly torture Wretches.</p>
<p>Equip a Yoke Fiend with a Torture Instrument. Deploy the Yoke Fiend next to a Wretch hiding behind a line-of-sight blocking terrain piece near your edge of the board. On every turn, use the Yoke Fiend's Torture Instrument to hit the Wretch and hope you add two Blood Markers.</p>
<p>This is safe (you are unlikely to kill the Wretch) but only generates a small amount of Blood Markers and wastes two models' worth of Ducats doing nothing in the back of the board. To generate enough Blood Markers, you'll probably need two Blood Batteries, ideally in different parts of the board to make it harder for the enemy to kill them both.</p>
<h3>Hotbox</h3>
<p>The Hotbox generates Blood Markers by hitting a group of Wretches with a Gas Grenade.</p>
<p>Equip a Yoke Fiend with a Muzzle and Gas Grenades. Deploy it near 3-4 Wretches huddled together behind a line-of-sight blocking terrain piece near your edge of the board. On every turn, throw a Gas Grenade at the ground in between the Wretches. It should generate a lot of Blood Markers, but with a small chance of killing some of the Wretches.</p>
<p>This is the most effective and reliable way to gain Blood Markers, though you'll have to pay for replacement Wretches if any die. The Hotbox is also a juicy target for the enemy to kill many models at once.</p>
<p>Remember, your opponent can spend Blood Markers from your Wretches to add +D to Injury Rolls or convert them to Bloodbath Rolls, so spend all your Blood Markers on a Wretch before throwing another grenade at them. You might need to reposition Wretches to set up the next grenade.</p>
<h3>Shotwretches</h3>
<p>Instead of buying Yoke Fiends, buy shotguns for your Wretches and use them as frontline screening infantry. Hope they score some Blood Markers on the enemy or at least gain some of their own. You can use them to block charges, try to score lucky hits, and if you get really lucky you might get some kills.</p>
<p>This is the riskiest way to get Blood Markers, but it's a lot more fun than parking them in the back of the board.</p>
<h2>Key models</h2>
<p>Most Court lists revolve around the &quot;Unholy Trinity&quot;: A Praetor, a Hunter, and a Sorceror. These three models are individually like mini-bosses, and together they form the core of your warband.</p>
<h3>Praetor</h3>
<p>Huge, fast, hits like a truck.</p>
<p>Good equipment choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinforced Armor. The model is too big to hide behind terrain, so it's going to get targeted a lot.</li>
<li>Malebranche Sword, or if you're hurting for Ducats, a Hellblade.</li>
<li>For melee focus: A Trench Shield or Sword for the other hand. Gas Grenades for a ranged ASSAULT weapon.</li>
<li>For ranged focus: A Serpent Assault Gun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hunter</h3>
<p>Possibly the most powerful single model in the game. Absurd, borderline game-breaking mobility with Left Hand Path and Shadow Walker. Great survivability, assuming you can fuel Oracle Beast Cloak with Blood Markers.</p>
<p>However, make one or two mistakes with the Hunter, and you'll probably lose the game. The Hunter activations are your most critical moments in every game.</p>
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> ever send the Hunter into a risky situation without enough Blood Markers in reserve to use Oracle Beast Cloak.</p>
<p>Good equipment choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinforced Armor for survivability. Needed here more than anywhere else.</li>
<li>Headtaker is the most common choice of melee weapon, since the Hunter can redeploy near unactivated models, shoot them with the bow to add a Blood Marker, then charge and attack with the Headtaker for a high probability of taking the enemy Out of Action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sorceror</h3>
<p>A support model that can use the Cast Spell ACTION to harass and control the field.</p>
<p>Good equipment choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trench Shield and Reinforced Armor for survivability.</li>
<li>Musical Instrument. You'll often spend your activation with a Dash, Burning Inferno, Move combo to peek out, toss a fireball and get back behind terrain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hell Knight</h3>
<p>Versatile, all around good combat model. Focus each one on either ranged or melee, don't try to do both well with the same model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranged build: Ophidian Rifle. Consider Incendiary Ammo.</li>
<li>Melee build: Hellblade, Sword or Trench Shield, Gas Grenades.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wretch</h3>
<p>Your source of Blood Markers. Give them a trench knife unless you're running a Shotwretch list.</p>
<h3>Yoke Fiend</h3>
<p>Equip as required for your Blood Marker generation strategy. In later campaign stages you can use them as combat units with Muzzles and Flamethrowers, with extra movement from Slavemaster. But in early campaign/one-offs, the money is better spent on the ELITE models.</p>
<h3>Desecrated Saint</h3>
<p>Only take a Desecrated Saint if you need a specific aura for your build. Otherwise, the money is better spent on powering up the Unholy Trinity and Hell Knights.</p>
<p>If you do take a saint, fill his arms with melee weapons (probably Swords and a Hellblade).</p>
<h3>Pit Locust.</h3>
<p>A cool model, but it costs too much. Invest in Hell Knights instead - you get more for your money.</p>
<p>If for some reason you get one, be sure to grab the Crown of Hellfire.</p>
<h3>Mercenaries</h3>
<p>There aren't any obvious must-have Mercenaries for the Court in 1.0.1, so pick up whatever seems cool. Sin Eater or Goetic Warlock or Scripture Guardian might be neat choices.</p>
<h2>Seven Deadly Sins</h2>
<p>Pick the sin that sounds fun to play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Envy: Run a Desecrated Saint to bog down enemy melee models with Aura of Envy. Run Coveted Poistion on your Praetor and swap places with the enemy at the funniest possible moment.</li>
<li>Sloth: Charm of Acedia is incredibly powerful. Skip Daemonium Meridianum and Morphean Mind, since you'll probably run a ranged build to maximize usage of Charm of Acedia.</li>
<li>Lust: Run ranged Hell Knights with Exquisite Pain. Cast Exquisite Pain on an enemy model, shoot the enemy, and use the Blood Markers on the Injury Roll.</li>
<li>Pride: Put Light of Samael on your Sorceror and start blasting.</li>
<li>Wrath: Equip models for melee and get high mobility. Run a Desecrated Saint to further buff using Aura of Wrath.</li>
<li>Gluttony: Use Uncaring Gluttony to strip defensive equipment like gas masks from enemy models. Run Belly of the Beast and Eater of the Flesh on your Praetor.</li>
<li>Greed: Run Body of Gold on a melee Hell Knight. Use Black Heart on important rolls that aren't already at at least +1D.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>In a campaign game, your goals are always:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not let any Elite model get taken Out of Action.</li>
<li>Do not let any Elite model get taken Out of Action.</li>
<li>Do not let any Elite model get taken Out of Action.</li>
<li>Kill the enemy.</li>
<li>Maybe do some objectives if it's convenient and not too risky to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not worth winning a campaign game if you gain Battle Scars that fuck you in the next 1-3 games!</p>
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>The goal during deployment is to delay placing the large models as long as possible. If you place them early, your opponent can deploy their ranged units to all shoot them on turn 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy Wretches and Yoke Fiends. Unless you are running Shotwretches, place them behind line-of-sight blocking terrain so the enemy can't shoot them.</li>
<li>Deploy Hell Knights</li>
<li>Deploy the Sorceror carrying the Musical Instrument, followed by the Hunter within Musical Instrument range.</li>
<li>Deploy the Desecrated Saint and Praetor last.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn 1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Activate Wretches to force the opponent to activate their models before your Hell Knights, Hunter or Sorceror are within line of sight</li>
<li>Generate Blood Markers</li>
<li>If you have enough Blood Markers for both Left Hand Path and Oracle Beast Cloak, then Dash, Left Hand Path, Shoot with the Bow of Lethe, Charge an unactivated model, and attack with the Headtaker. You must do this such that in <em>any</em> outcome, your Hunter is not in danger from your opponent's deadliest models. This is your most important activation of the entire game, so think very carefully about your choices like a puzzle. If you can't do it safely, or don't have enough Blood Markers, delay activating the Hunter, or Dash, Shoot, and Move into cover instead.</li>
<li>Activate other models as opportune.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Later Turns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize keeping the Hunter alive.</li>
<li>Kill targets of opportunity while managing risk. Aim to force your opponent into making Morale Checks.</li>
<li>If objectives are opportune and low risk, pick them up, but prioritize survival of Elites over objectives.</li>
</ul>
