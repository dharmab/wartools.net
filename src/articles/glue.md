# What Glue Should I Use for My Miniatures?

A guide to picking the right glue for plastic, resin, and PLA miniatures.

## Injection-Molded Plastic Miniatures

_Anything that comes on sprues, e.g. most Games Workshop, Wargames Atlantic, Trench Crusade Prussians..._

**Plastic cement** is ideal for plastic miniatures. It can enter small gaps and chemically melt the plastic, creating a strong bond between parts.

If you don't have plastic cement, you can use superglue.

## Resin Miniatures

_Anything that comes out of an SLA 3D printer or resin mold, e.g. Trench Crusade Kickstarter miniatures, Forge World, many smaller miniature printers..._

Resin miniatures (such as those printed on SLA 3D printers or cast from resin molds) are not chemically compatible with plastic cement. **Use superglue.**

## PLA Miniatures

_Anything that comes out of an FDM 3D printer - most commonly, 3D printed bases and terrain..._

Miniatures 3D printed in PLA (i.e. on an FDM 3D printer) are not chemically compatible with plastic cement. **Use superglue.**

# What Glues Are Good?

## Superglue (Cyanoacrylate, "CA Glue")

Thicker gel superglue is a great superglue for miniatures. The gel helps hold parts in place while you adjust their position, and offers better control of where the glue goes.

**Loctite Gel Super Glue** and **Gorilla Super Glue Gel** are both widely available at hardware stores, but come in tiny bottles. My favorite is **Starbond Medium** which comes in a large bottle with many applicator tips at a good price.

## Plastic Cement

**Tamiya Extra Thin Cement** is a great brush-on plastic cement. When the bottle runs out, refill it with **Tamiya Airbrush Cleaner** - it's almost chemically identical and costs less per milliliter.

**Revel Contacta Professional Glue** comes in a very useful needle applicator bottle. If the needle ever clogs, you can clear the clog with heat.
